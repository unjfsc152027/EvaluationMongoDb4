b) > rs.help()
	:::
		> rs.help()
				rs.status()                                { replSetGetStatus : 1 } checks repl set status
				rs.initiate()                              { replSetInitiate : null } initiates set with default settings
				rs.initiate(cfg)                           { replSetInitiate : cfg } initiates set with configuration cfg
				rs.conf()                                  get the current configuration object from local.system.replset
				rs.reconfig(cfg)                           updates the configuration of a running replica set with cfg (disconnects)
				rs.add(hostportstr)                        add a new member to the set with default attributes (disconnects)
				rs.add(membercfgobj)                       add a new member to the set with extra attributes (disconnects)
				rs.addArb(hostportstr)                     add a new member which is arbiterOnly:true (disconnects)
				rs.stepDown([stepdownSecs, catchUpSecs])   step down as primary (disconnects)
				rs.syncFrom(hostportstr)                   make a secondary sync from the given member
				rs.freeze(secs)                            make a node ineligible to become primary for the time specified
				rs.remove(hostportstr)                     remove a host from the replica set (disconnects)
				rs.secondaryOk()                               allow queries on secondary nodes
		
				rs.printReplicationInfo()                  check oplog size and time range
				rs.printSecondaryReplicationInfo()             check replica set members and replication lag
				db.isMaster()                              check who is primary
				db.hello()                              check who is primary reconfiguration helpers disconnect from the database so the shell will display an error, even if the command succeeds.

		sh.stopBalancer()                         stops the balancer so chunks are not balanced automatically
